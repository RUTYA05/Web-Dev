    <!-- What is an ID?
An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations. -->

<!-- What are Classes?
The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements. -->
